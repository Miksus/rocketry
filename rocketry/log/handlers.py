        Prepare a record for queuing. The object returned by this method is

        The base implementation formats the record to merge the message and
        arguments, and removes unpickleable items from the record in-place.
        Specifically, it overwrites the record's `msg` and
        `message` attributes with the merged message (obtained by
        calling the handler's `format` method), and sets the `args`,
        `exc_info` and `exc_text` attributes to None.

        You might want to override this method if you want to convert
        the record to a dict or JSON string, or send a modified copy
        of the record while leaving the original intact.
