Integrate Django (or Django Rest Framework)
===========================================

This cookbook will use DRF (Django REST Framework) as an example, but the syntax is exactly
the same for Django.

First, let's `create a new command <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/custom-management-commands>`_ for setting up our jobs (we will call it ``inittasks.py``):

.. code-block:: python

    # Create Rocketry app
    from rocketry import Rocketry
    app = Rocketry(execution="async")

    # import BaseCommand
    from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

    # Create some tasks

    @app.task('every 5 seconds')
    async def do_things():
        ...

    class Command(BaseCommand):
        help = "Setup the periodic tasks runner"

        def handle(self, *args, **options):
            app.run()


Next, you can just run in your ``entrypoint`` script (or in your shell) the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   ... # connect to the database, set PRODUCTION=1, etc...

    # if you deploy on Docker, it's probably better to run this in the background,
    # so you can run your HTTP server afterwards
    python manage.py inittasks &


And you're set ! It's really as simple as that!

Using the Asynchronous ORM
--------------------------

Now, you might have the following error if you use Querysets, or try to use the ORM in your task:

.. code-block:: bash

   Django: SynchronousOnlyOperation: You cannot call this from an async context - use a thread or sync_to_async

.. warning::

    Some guides might suggest setting the ``DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE`` environment value to ``True``.
    This is **not** the recommended way. The UNSAFE keyword is here for a reason.

For our example, we will use the same file for simplicity, but it's fine to move your tasks to another file
(as long as you don't forget to import them !).

.. code-block:: python

    # Create Rocketry app
    from rocketry import Rocketry
    app = Rocketry(execution="async")

    # import BaseCommand
    from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

    # this is a synchronous operation that will work in an async context!
    def do_things_with_users(name):
        for user in User.objects.filter(name=name):
            print(f'I did something with {user} !')

    @app.task('every 5 seconds')
    async def do_things():
        await sync_to_async(do_things_with_users)(name='John Doe')
        ...

    class Command(BaseCommand):
        help = "Setup the periodic tasks runner"

        def handle(self, *args, **options):
            app.run()

You can even manually run the ``do_things_with_users`` function from a view now,
if that's something you would want. Let's add this view in our ``views.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

    # this could be any path where the code you want to run is stored
    from api.commands import tasks as tasklist
    import asyncio

    ...

    class TaskView(APIView):
        def get(self, request):

            """
                This function is not ran by our scheduler, and runs in a synchronous context in our example
            """

            name = request.GET.get('name')
            if not name :
                return Response({
                        'error': 'missing a parameter (expected something like ?name=job_name )'
                    },
                    status=HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
                )

            try:

                task = getattr(tasklist, name)

                loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
                asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)

                loop.run_until_complete(task())

            except Exception as err:

                return Response({
                        'error': 'task failure',
                        'logs': f'Failed with: {str(err)}',
                    },
                    status=HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
                )

            return Response({
                    'message': 'successfully ran the task',
                },
                status=HTTP_200_OK,
            )

Actiavate Rocketry At Server Start
----------------------------------

Another way to integrate rocketry with django is to create a file in each app
called ``scheduled_tasks.py`` with the tasks referent to that app:

.. code-block:: python

    from asgiref.sync import sync_to_async
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User


    def do_things_with_user():
        print(f'X {User.objects.first()}!')


    async def run_do_things_with_user_app_x():
        await sync_to_async(do_things_with_user)()


    def register_scheduled_tasks_app_x(app):
        app.task('every 10 seconds', func=run_do_things_with_user_app_x)

And than, in the same module where the file ``wsgi.py`` is located, add a file called
``init_scheduled_tasks.py`` (or anywhere you would like, just make sure to import the file
correctly), which will import the register functions of each file of tasks and
initialize rocketry in another process:

.. code-block:: python

    from multiprocessing import Process
    from rocketry import Rocketry
    from x.scheduled_tasks import register_scheduled_tasks_app_x
    from y.scheduled_tasks import register_scheduled_tasks_app_y


    def init_scheduled_tasks():
        app = Rocketry(execution="async")

        register_scheduled_tasks_app_x(app)
        register_scheduled_tasks_app_y(app)

        p = Process(target=app.run)
        p.start()

After that, go to the ``wsgi.py`` file, import the ``init_scheduled_tasks`` function
and call it after ``application = get_wsgi_application()``:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application

    ...

    application = get_wsgi_application()

    from .init_scheduled_tasks import init_scheduled_tasks
    init_scheduled_tasks()

Notice that if you are using gunicorn with multiple workers, each worker will create one
process of rocketry which will be running all the tasks. This is aimed primarily towards
development where you need to restart the server all the time and the server is single
threaded.

.. note ::
    You will only need to use ``sync_to_async`` if you use the asynchronous ORM. The usage is well documented in
    `Django's documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/async/>`_.
